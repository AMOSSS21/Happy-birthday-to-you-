                Honestly, I don’t even know where to start because putting into words how I feel about you never feels like enough. 
                You’ve become someone so incredibly special to me, more than you probably realize. The way you exist in my life, 
                your presence, your energy, your smile, even the smallest moments we share, they all mean so much to me.<br><br>

                You’re not just important to me. You’re someone who has quietly become a part of my days, my thoughts, my happiness. 
                Someone who can change my mood without even trying. And I genuinely mean this, I love you. Not in some loud, dramatic way, 
                but in that real, steady, sincere way where you just deeply care about someone and want the best for them always.<br><br>

                On your special day, I just want you to know how much you matter to me. How much I appreciate you. 
                <b>Thanks for always being there for me.</b> No matter what happens, I’ll always have a soft corner for you, 
                always support you, always be someone who stands by you. Because that’s what you deserve.<br><br>

                I hope this year brings you everything—happiness, peace, success, and everything your heart wishes for. 
                And selfishly, I hope I get to keep being part of your smiles, your laughs, your world.<br><br>

                <b>I will always love you with all my heart and forever.</b>
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #c2185b; font-size: 1.2rem;">
                Stay amazing. Stay you. I will always love you with all my heart and will forever. 😌❤️
