            Honestly, I don’t even know where to start because putting into words how I feel about you never feels like enough. 
            You’ve become someone so incredibly special to me, more than you probably realize.<br><br>

            You’re not just important to me. You’re someone who has quietly become a part of my days, my thoughts, my happiness. 
            Someone who can change my mood without even trying. And I genuinely mean this, I love you. Not in some loud, dramatic way, 
            but in that real, steady, sincere way where you just deeply care about someone and want the best for them always.<br><br>

            On your special day, I just want you to know how much you matter to me. How much I appreciate you. 
            <b>Thanks for always being there for me.</b> No matter what happens, I’ll always have a soft corner for you, 
            always support you, always be someone who stands by you. Because that’s what you deserve.<br><br>

            I hope this year brings you everything—happiness, peace, success, and everything your heart wishes for. 
            <b>I will always love you with all my heart and forever.</b>
        </p>
